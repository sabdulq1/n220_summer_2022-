<h1>Reflection</h1>

<h2>Planning of my code was very simple in 3 steps Making div, adding variables, adding onclick function. I completed making div part very easily but I struggled a lot in 
    multiplying div 10%. To be honest after searching a lot on google I came across  offsetHeight/ offsetwWidth. Eventually I was able to do it after many tries 
  <br/> I have commented few of my previous attempts in app.js if you can please review them and let me know what I was doing wrong it would be very helpful 
<br/>The learning  for me was

<br/><mark>offsetHeight/ offsetwWidth</mark>
